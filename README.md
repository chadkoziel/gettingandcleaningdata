# gettingandcleaningdata
Peer-graded assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course

This assignment demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a dataset.


Using the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", made available via the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the "run_analysis.r" algorithm:

- extracts the training and test features and labels
- subsets for features of interest
- adds intuitively descriptive variable names and label values
- creates a tidy data set
- summarizes the means of the tidy data set by subject and activity

The CodeBook.md file describes the variables, the data, and transformations to produce the tidy data sets.
